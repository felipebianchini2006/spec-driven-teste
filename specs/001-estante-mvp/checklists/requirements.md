# Specification Quality Checklist: Estante Virtual MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Validation Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: All sections focus on "what" and "why" without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches. Written in plain language suitable for business stakeholders.

2. **Requirements**: All 16 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Each uses clear MUST/SHOULD language and specifies exact constraints (character limits, validation rules).

3. **Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentage, count). No technology-specific terms - all focused on user experience and system behavior.

4. **User Scenarios**: Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) each with clear value proposition, independent testability, and detailed acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.

5. **Edge Cases**: Seven edge cases identified covering boundary conditions, error scenarios, and data validation.

6. **Scope**: MVP clearly bounded - no login system, no multi-user support, no delete functionality. Assumptions section explicitly documents what's out of scope.

7. **Entities**: Two key entities (Livro, Avaliação) defined with attributes and relationships in business terms, not database schema.

**No clarifications needed** - all requirements have reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command. The MVP is well-scoped, independently testable user stories enable incremental delivery, and all success criteria are verifiable without knowing implementation details.
